About the project
The Carrer Path gives you access to a collection of test, videos, articles, tips and more for different careers in the tech industry, including jobs that don't require coding. So, if you are looking for help for yourself or others who are about to start and/or develop a career in technology, a technology plan is the place to start.
 
The roadmaps or step-by-step instructions for the different technology jobs listed on our website have been carefully selected. The resource collection has been carefully prepared to provide instruction to students.
